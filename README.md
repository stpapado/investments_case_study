# investments case study

“We need to analyze governance of specific companies within the investment universe. 
We have to be able to know who is involved in several companies and the interactions between companies”

• use the website to build companies and persons dataset
• build some analysis on dataset
• build a representation of the dataset
• you are free to use additional data to enhance the analysis

<br />

->**Use extract_data.ipynb to get the data from webpage and save them in dictionaries- which are used for analysis in data_analysis.ipynb.**

• In extract_data.ipynb you need to provide some input like the bussiness type or whether you want to save data in dict., etc.

• The data_analysis.ipynb is based on the bussiness type I worked on (i.e. real estate & immobilier) and it calls these two dictionaries: real_estate_dict.xlsx. and immobilier_dict.xlsx.
